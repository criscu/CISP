# CISP
Causal Inference and Stock Prediction

## Context
In the field of finance, analyzing stock markets is of paramount importance for investors and economic actors. However, determining the true causal relationships between financial events and market movements is a complex challenge. The CISP project, short for Causal Inference and Stock Prediction, has set out to address this challenge by using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to establish causal relationships from stock reports and develop a predictive model based on these relationships.

Establishing correlations involves identifying statistical coincidences between two variables, meaning determining whether variations in one variable are associated with variations in another. On the other hand, establishing causal relationships goes beyond this by seeking to determine whether one variable actually influences the other, creating a cause-and-effect relationship.

Causal relationships provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern phenomena. Unlike correlations, they allow us to answer the "why" question rather than just the "what." This means that they can help identify the real factors that influence an event and predict how a change in one variable can affect another.

In the context of the CISP project, establishing causal relationships between financial events and market movements will help understand how these events actually impact stock prices. This can be highly valuable for investors, financial analysts, and other market participants, as it will enable them to make informed decisions based on a deep understanding of the underlying factors.

## Project objectives
### Establish Causal Relationships:
The primary goal of the CISP project is to identify and establish causal relationships from a vast corpus of stock reports. This involves understanding how various events, such as financial announcements, political decisions, or economic fluctuations, influence financial markets. These causal relationships are essential for comprehending the underlying mechanisms that shape the markets and for anticipating future reactions based on events.

### Develop a Predictive Model:
The second objective is to use the identified causal relationships to create a robust predictive model. This model will be designed to anticipate changes in stock prices based on financial and economic events. It can enable investors and financial actors to make informed decisions, taking into account the causal factors that influence the markets.

## Methodology:
### Identification and Extraction of Variables:
Input Variables: These are also known as independent variables that are likely to influence financial markets (they consist of data on a multitude of economic, political, and other relevant events).

Output Variables: These are also known as dependent variables, which correspond to indicators of market movements (they consist of data on stock prices, stock market indices, market trends, etc.).

Confounding Variables: These are variables that do not have a direct relationship with the input and output variables but can still influence them (their treatment helps to neutralize their effects).
### Causal Inferences:
The goal is to employ advanced causal inference techniques to establish cause-and-effect relationships among the identified variables. This step is crucial for understanding how input variables influence output variables by linking information corresponding to causes with information corresponding to consequences.

### Predictive Model:
Once causal relationships are identified, the aim is to develop a predictive model based on these causal relationships.

This model will serve as the final deliverable of the CISP project. It will be capable of predicting stock market fluctuations based on journalistic information and financial events.
